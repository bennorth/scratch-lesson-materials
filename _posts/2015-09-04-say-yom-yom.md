title: "Get the mouse to say 'yom yom'"
excerpt: "When the mouse eats a donut, it should say 'yom yom'."
---

As the mouse makes its way round the screen, eating the donuts, it
should say 'yom yom' every time it gets one.

We'll do this by using one of the 'say' blocks, which is in the 'Looks' section:

{:.display-script}
![](/images/mouse-yom-yom/say-for-seconds-block.png)

If you scroll right in the mouse's scripts, you'll find a 'hat' block

{:.display-script}
![](/images/mouse-yom-yom/when-I-receive.png)

Whatever you attach to the bottom of this will be run whenever the mouse
eats a donut.  Try making the mouse say something suitable when it gets
a donut!
